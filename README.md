# Information about Formux
Formux is School project (called Gymnasiearbete in sweden) exploring automated form A/B testing. We are building a [web app](https://github.com/formux-dev/web-user) capable of displaying any form sent from our [backend](https://github.com/formux-dev/backend). 

## Why use Formux
What makes Formux stand out is it's ablilty to change theming on the fly, based on user feedback. We have the ablity to load a theme config when the form loads. When a user completes a form in the web app, they are asked to rate the desing of the form on a scale form 1 to 5. This informs our backend about how the theme presented to the user preformed. 

## Sounds great, how do I try it?
We are still in the process of fleshing out the system. The MVP will not have a complete [admin](https://github.com/formux-dev/web-admin) UI for creating forms and displaying responses. It will just focus on making the end-user experience and theme optimization as smooth as possible.

## I want to help
Contributions are welcome! We'll check for new ones regularly and review them as fast as possible.
