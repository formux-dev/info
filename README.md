## Why use Formux?
Formux is a form platform. What makes Formux stand out is its ability to change theming on the fly, based on user feedback. We have the ability to load a theme config when the form loads. When a user completes a form in the web app, they are asked to rate the design of the form on a scale from 1 to 5. This informs our backend about how the theme presented to the user preformed.

## Sounds great, how do I try it?
We are still in the process of fleshing out the system. The MVP will not have a complete admin UI for creating forms and displaying responses. It will just focus on making the end-user experience and theme optimization as smooth as possible.

## What are the repositoies for 
We are building a [web app(https://github.com/formux-dev/web-user) capable of displaying any form sent from our [backend](https://github.com/formux-dev/backend). After of MVP we are builing the [admin UI](https://github.com/formux-dev/web-admin) too.

## I want to help
Contributions are welcome! We'll check for new ones regularly and review them as fast as possible.
